                <br>
                <p class="story">The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee <br>after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,<br> his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.</p>
                <p class="sto-lin">
                    The modern version of roasted coffee originated in Arabia. During the 13th century, coffee was extremely popular with<br> the Muslim community for its stimulant powers, which proved useful during long prayer sessions. By parching and boiling<br> the coffee beans, rendering them infertile, the Arabs were able to corner the market on coffee crops. In fact, tradition <br>says that not a single coffee plant existed outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s, when Baba Budan, an Indian pilgrim,<br> left Mecca with fertile beans fastened to a strap across his abdomen. Baba’s beans resulted in a new and competitive<br> European coffee trade.<br>

                    <p class="story">The coffee bean journey has been a mystery to so many coffee drinkers over the years. Some people believe that coffee comes straight from the bag to the cup, but it’s so much more than that.

                        Have you ever thought about the coffee bean journey as you are drinking your delicious morning cup of coffee? Have you thought about all it has gone through before it gets poured into your cup?
                        
                        It’s a long process that involves not only you the purchaser, but it also involves many farmers, pickers, producers, cuppers and shippers to get your coffee to where it is now.
                        
                        
                        Let’s take a moment to look at this complicated process and embrace the journey of the coffee bean — from the moment it has been grown and harvested — to the moment you pour your very first cup</p>
